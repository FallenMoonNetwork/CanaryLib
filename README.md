CanaryMod
=========

CanaryMod is a Minecraft Server wrapper and library with built-in data
management features as well as player permissions and groups management.
CanaryMod provides a stable and feature-rich framework that makes sure that
Plugins written today, will still work in months without the need of updating
on each Minecraft update. As server owner, this allows you to spend more time
on managing your server, making it awesome, instead of waiting for all your
plugins to update each time.

As Plugin Developer our Mod allows you to concentrate on the things that make
your Plugin great and unique - you won’t ever need to bother about implementing
data storage or resolving dependencies with other plugins. We do the dirty work
for you, you go and make amazing plugins. It’s as easy as that!

This repository contains the library.
